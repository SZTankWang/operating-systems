To run the project:
only need to invoke chef process. I add one more argument for controlling the time a maker needs to finish one salad

So do:
make -> 
./chef -n <num of salads> -m <chef rest time> -c <mkr time for a salad>

The maker processes are going to be forked by chef

-To examine the execution of the process:
-- for each maker, there will be an individual log file named "MKR{i}", where i belongs to {0,1,2}.

-- for the parrallel working period, there is a public log file named "public".

Those files will also be outputted on tty at the end of chef's execution. 

Thank you!
